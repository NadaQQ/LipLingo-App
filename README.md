# LipLingo-App

LipLingo is an Android application that utilizes
machine learning to help individuals with voice
impairments or hearing loss. LipLingo’s primary
feature is a lip-reading interpreter, which translates a
person’s lip movements into text, whether through
video recording within the app or by uploading pre-
recorded videos. LipLingo also offers interactive lip-
reading lessons and challenges, making learning this
crucial skill engaging and accessible to all.
